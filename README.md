# platform-automation

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows and composite actions shared across
**blackoutsecure** repositories.

This repo is public so any repository (including forks) can call these
workflows directly without needing a token.

### Configuration model

- **`secrets:`** — things that grant access (Docker Hub token, Balena
  API token, optional `ACTIONS_REPO_TOKEN`).
- **`vars:`** — things that identify *what* you're publishing (image
  name, namespace, block name). Set them once on the repository or
  organisation and the caller workflow stays free of literals.

The Docker Hub namespace is **public information** (it appears in every
`docker pull` URL), so it's modelled as `vars.DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` /
`inputs.dockerhub_namespace` rather than a secret. The legacy
`secrets.DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` is still accepted for back-compat.

## `docker-build-push.yml` — reusable workflow

Build a multi-arch Docker image (amd64 + arm64 by default), push each
architecture by digest, and assemble a single OCI manifest with the
resolved version tag (plus optional `:latest` and extra tags).

### Minimal caller

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  docker:
    uses: blackoutsecure/platform-automation/.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml@main
    with:
      image_name: my-service
      dockerhub_namespace: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE }}
    secrets:
      DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
      DOCKERHUB_TOKEN:    ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Default behaviour

- **Push trigger:** the workflow pushes only when the caller event is a
  `push` to the default branch. Override with the `push` input.
- **Version resolution:** `auto` cascade → Dockerfile `ARG APP_VERSION` →
  `VERSION` file → annotated git tag → commit SHA.
- **Platforms:** `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`. Set `multi_arch: false`
  for amd64-only.
- **Tagging:** `:<version>`, `:latest` (toggle with `latest`), plus any
  caller-supplied `extra_tags`.
- **Labels:** standard OCI labels (`created`, `version`, `revision`,
  `source`) are attached to every build.

### Inputs

| `runner_type` | string | `cloud` | `cloud` (GitHub-hosted) or `self-hosted`. |
| `update_description` | boolean | `true` | Sync the repo README + short description to Docker Hub after a successful manifest push. No-op when not pushing. |
| `readme_filepath` | string | `./README.md` | Path to the README uploaded as the Docker Hub full description. |
| `short_description` | string | `''` | Docker Hub short description (max 100 chars). Empty leaves the existing one untouched. |
| `enable_url_completion` | boolean | `true` | Convert relative URLs in the README to absolute GitHub URLs. |

### Secrets

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|:--------:|-------------|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | ✔ | Docker Hub username. |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | ✔ | Docker Hub access token (not your password). |
| `DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` | ✖ | **Deprecated.** Pass `dockerhub_namespace:` (or set `vars.DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE`) instead. Still accepted for back-compat. |
| `ACTIONS_REPO_TOKEN` | ✖ | Only needed if `actions_repo` is private. Falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `image` | Fully qualified image reference (`registry/namespace/name`). |
| `image_version` | Resolved version tag. |
| `namespace` | Effective Docker Hub namespace. |

### Self-hosted runners

Set `runner_type: self-hosted`. The workflow expects runners labelled:

- amd64: `self-hosted, Linux, x64`
- arm64: `self-hosted, Linux, ARM64`

## `resolve-docker-image-tags` — composite action

Standalone version/tag resolver. Usable outside the reusable workflow.

```yaml
- uses: blackoutsecure/platform-automation/.github/actions/shared/resolve-docker-image-tags@main
  id: tags
  with:
    version_source: auto            # auto | dockerfile | file | git_tag | sha
    dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    dockerfile_arg: APP_VERSION
    version_file: VERSION
    distro: alpine                  # optional
    extra_tags: |
      stable
      prod
- run: echo "version=${{ steps.tags.outputs.version }}"
```

### Outputs

- `version` — resolved version tag
- `short_sha` — shortened commit SHA
- `build_date` — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
- `source` — which resolver path produced the version
- `extra_tags` — newline-separated deduplicated tag list

See [action.yml](.github/actions/shared/resolve-docker-image-tags/action.yml)
for the full input list.

## `sync-dockerhub-description` — composite action

Uploads a repository README and short description to Docker Hub. Wraps
[`peter-evans/dockerhub-description`](https://github.com/peter-evans/dockerhub-description)
with preflight validation (README exists, credentials/repository slug
are non-empty and single-line, short description fits Docker Hub's
100-char cap) so failures surface with a clear message instead of a
401 from the registry API.

It is invoked automatically by the `update-description` job in
[`docker-build-push.yml`](.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml) after
a successful manifest push, and can also be used standalone:

```yaml
- uses: blackoutsecure/platform-automation/.github/actions/sync-dockerhub-description@main
  with:
    repository: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE }}/my-service
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
    readme_filepath: ./README.md
    short_description: A short tagline shown on the Docker Hub repo page.
```

See [action.yml](.github/actions/sync-dockerhub-description/action.yml)
for the full input list.

---

## `balena-block-publish.yml` — reusable workflow

Resolve a block version (same logic as the Docker workflow), optionally
sync the version back into `balena.yml`, and publish to balenaCloud via
[`balena-io/deploy-to-balena-action`](https://github.com/balena-io/deploy-to-balena-action).

### Required configuration on the caller repo

| Kind     | Name                  | Used for |
|----------|-----------------------|----------|
| Variable | `BALENA_BLOCK_NAME`   | Block slug (without namespace). |
| Variable | `BALENA_NAMESPACE`    | Balena user/org that owns the block. |
| Variable | `DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE` | Docker Hub namespace for the image. |
| Secret   | `BALENA_API_TOKEN`    | balenaCloud API token (forwarded via `secrets:`). |

### Default behaviour

- **Publish trigger:** publishes only on `push` to the default branch.
  Override with the `publish` input (or via `workflow_dispatch`).
- **Version resolution:** `auto` cascade → Dockerfile `ARG APP_VERSION` →
  `VERSION` file → annotated git tag → commit SHA.
- **`balena.yml` sync:** when `sync_balena_yml: true` (default) and the
  workflow is publishing on the default branch, the top-level `version:`
  is rewritten and committed back. Requires `contents: write` on the
  caller job (set in the template).
- **Concurrency:** balenaCloud rejects concurrent pushes to the same
  block; in-progress runs are never cancelled.

See [.github/workflows/balena-block-publish.yml](.github/workflows/balena-block-publish.yml)
for the full input/output list.

## `github-release.yml` — reusable workflow

Create or update a GitHub Release with a rendered Markdown body that
includes `docker pull` commands, supported architectures, and any
caller-supplied context. Wraps
[`softprops/action-gh-release`](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release)
(SHA-pinned) and the [`render-release-notes`](.github/actions/render-release-notes/action.yml)
composite action.

### Default behaviour

- **Trigger-agnostic.** The caller passes `tag_name:` explicitly, so
  the workflow works on `release` events, tag pushes, or manual
  dispatches without hard-coding event assumptions.
- **Pre-release auto-detection.** Tags shaped like `vX.Y.Z-<suffix>`
  (e.g. `v1.2.3-rc1`) are marked as pre-releases automatically. Override
  with `prerelease: 'true'` or `prerelease: 'false'`.
- **Update-in-place.** Re-running against the same `tag_name:`
  patches the existing release body instead of erroring.
- **Auto-generated notes.** GitHub's PR/contributor notes are appended
  after the rendered template body when `generate_release_notes: true`
  (the default).
- **Least-privilege.** Workflow defaults to `contents: read`; the
  publish job opts into `contents: write` itself — the caller doesn't
  need to grant it.

### Template substitution

The bundled template at
[.github/actions/render-release-notes/default-template.md](.github/actions/render-release-notes/default-template.md)
supports these placeholders out of the box:

| Placeholder | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| `{{ release_name }}` | `release_name` input (defaults to `tag_name`). |
| `{{ tag_name }}`     | `tag_name` input. |
| `{{ version }}`      | `version` input (defaults to `tag_name` minus leading `v`). |
| `{{ short_sha }}`    | First 12 chars of `github.sha`. |
| `{{ commit_url }}`   | Auto-built from `github.server_url` + `github.repository`. |
| `{{ build_date }}`   | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp at render time. |
| `{{ image_section }}`     | Rendered when `image_ref:` is set. |
| `{{ platforms_section }}` | Rendered when `platforms:` is set. |
| `{{ extra_section }}`     | Bullet list built from `extra_context:` `KEY=VALUE` pairs. |

Keys passed via `extra_context:` are also available as `{{ KEY }}` for
custom templates. Substitution is regex-based on a fixed key shape
(`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`) — there is no template-engine evaluation, so
user-supplied values cannot inject runner commands.

See [.github/workflows/github-release.yml](.github/workflows/github-release.yml)
for the full input/output list.

## `monitor-upstream-release.yml` — reusable workflow

Poll a public GitHub repo on a schedule and react when its `latest`
release tag changes. Designed for downstream repos that wrap an upstream
project (e.g. building a custom Docker image of `actions/runner`,
`balena-io/balena-cli`, `k3s-io/k3s`) and want their pipeline to
rebuild whenever upstream cuts a release — without polling logic
living in every caller repo.

### Default behaviour

- **Tracking file.** A small JSON file at `inputs.track_file` (default
  `.github/upstream/tracked-release.json`) records the last-seen `repo`,
  `tag`, `version`, and resolved `commit` SHA. The file is committed
  back to the default branch when the upstream changes; subsequent runs
  diff against it to detect change.
- **Real commit SHA.** The release's `target_commitish` field is often
  a branch name (`main`), and the Git Refs API returns the *tag-object*
  SHA for annotated tags — neither is the commit you want. The workflow
  resolves the actual commit SHA via `repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<tag>`,
  which handles lightweight and annotated tags uniformly.
- **Dispatch-then-commit ordering.** Downstream workflows are
  dispatched **before** the tracking file is committed — if dispatch
  fails, the marker is unchanged and the next scheduled run retries.
- **Concurrent-push safety.** `git push` retries up to `push_retries`
  attempts with a `git pull --rebase` between tries.
- **No false positives.** `published_at` is deliberately excluded from
  the tracking file — GitHub re-publishing a release with a tweaked
  timestamp must not look like a new version.
- **Least-privilege.** Workflow defaults to `contents: read`; the
  monitor job opts into `contents: write` (for the marker commit) and
  `actions: write` (for `gh workflow run`).

### Optional `DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger further `workflow_run` /
`workflow_dispatch` chains. If your dispatched workflow itself needs
to trigger another workflow, pass a fine-scoped PAT or GitHub App
token via the `DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret.

See [.github/workflows/monitor-upstream-release.yml](.github/workflows/monitor-upstream-release.yml)
for the full input/output list.

## Security notes

This repository is public and these workflows run in downstream repos
with access to their secrets, so they follow GitHub's
[security hardening guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions):

- **Pinned actions.** Every `uses:` reference is pinned to a 40-char
  commit SHA, with the human-readable version in a trailing comment.
  [Dependabot](.github/dependabot.yml) opens grouped PRs weekly to bump
  the SHAs as new releases ship.
- **Injection-safe scripts.** All user-controlled inputs reach shell via
  `env:` — no `${{ ... }}` expansion happens inside `run:` bodies,
  eliminating the
  [script-injection class of vulnerability](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/).
- **Least-privilege tokens.** `permissions: contents: read` at the
  workflow level; jobs that need `contents: write` (only the
  `sync-balena-yml` job) opt in explicitly.
- **No credential persistence.** Every checkout uses
  `persist-credentials: false`, except the one job that has to push a
  commit back to the default branch.
- **Strict input validation.** Tags, identifiers, image names, slugs,
  Balena block names, and `actions_repo` overrides are all regex-checked
  before use; secrets are rejected if they contain stray whitespace.
- **Concurrency safety.** Publish jobs use `cancel-in-progress: false`
  to avoid leaving partial releases behind.
- **No `pull_request_target`.** Untrusted PR code is never checked out
  with elevated privileges.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the vulnerability-disclosure process.

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Edit workflows/actions under `.github/`.
3. Open a PR — [lint.yml](.github/workflows/lint.yml) runs `actionlint`
   and `shellcheck` automatically.
4. Test end-to-end by calling the reusable workflow from a downstream
   repo with `@<your-branch>`.

When adding a new third-party action, pin it to a commit SHA and append
the version in a trailing comment, e.g.:

```yaml
- uses: owner/action@1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678 # v1.2.3
```
